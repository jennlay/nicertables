Make Nice Correlation and Logistic Regression Tables

Author: jennlay

This package contains functions that take either a) raw data or b)
badly-formatted analysis output and transforms it into results tables that are
ready to use for other purposes. There is currently one function that creates
a correlation table from raw data and outputs it to a csv file, and another
function that takes logistical regression output from a totally unformatted text
document (Mplus output) and puts it into a data frame. These are convenience
functions that are useful for the author's current data analytical work.
