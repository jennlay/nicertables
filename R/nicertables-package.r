#' nicertables: Make well-formatted analysis tables
#'
#' author: @lay_jennifer
#'
#' This package contains functions that take raw data and badly-formatted analysis output and transforms it into results
#' tables that are ready to use for other purposes. There is currently one function that creates a correlation table from
#' raw data and outputs it to a csv file, and another function that takes logistical regression output from a totally
#' unformatted text document (Mplus output) and puts it into a data frame. These are convenience functions that are
#' probably most only useful for the package author...
