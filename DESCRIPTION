Package: nicertables
Title: Make Nice Correlation and Logistic Regression Tables
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Jennifer", "Lay", email = "jennifer.lay@psych.ubc.ca", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package contains functions that take either a) raw data or b)
    badly-formatted analysis output and transforms it into results tables that are
    ready to use for other purposes. There is currently one function that creates
    a correlation table from raw data and outputs it to a csv file, and another
    function that takes logistical regression output from a totally unformatted text
    document (Mplus output) and puts it into a data frame. These are convenience
    functions that are useful for the author's current data analytical work.
